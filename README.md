# Abstract 

Network intrusion and fraudulent transactions are gaining traction due to technology advancement. It is necessary to identify these threats using advanced method such as use of Machine learning frameworks as part of intrusion detection software. These Machine learning frameworks will be trained using the network signatures which are classified into various threat and normal transactions. The train model will be exposed to the network endpoint and receives the network signatures when a transaction happens and classifies them into a threat classes or a normal transaction

# Dataset

As part of the Analysis, the dataset should have captured the latest network transaction patterns and threats. For this research project, the dataset - UNSW-NB15 is considered, since it is collected recently and has recorded various latest network transactions patterns. The dataset was published via IEEE platform by Researchers of University of South Wales (UNSW) as part of 2015 Military Communications and Information Systems Conference (MilCIS) and made available to the research community.
